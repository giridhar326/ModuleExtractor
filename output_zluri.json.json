      "module": "HTTP Request with Callback Action",
      "Description": " This action helps users make anHTTP requestto an external service and send a configured callback request, using which we\u2019ll mark the action as completed or failed on Zluri\u2019s end. This action can be used for cases where users would like to trigger a workflow in a third-party application and mark the action as completed in Zluri once the workflow has completed in the third-party application.  The action has two steps: Step 1 - Configuring the HTTP request Step 2 - Configuring the callback URL for that action in the external application or service A callback URL unique to that specific action is automatically generated from Zluri\u2019s end that can be configured on the end application or service that the HTTP request is made to. You can copy the callback URL from Zluri\u2019s UI to the external service that you want to make the HTTP request to The callback URL is expected to be a POST request with the format being: Replace the text between the braces{{...}}with your execution ID. Zluri expects the \u201cstatus\u201d to be sent in the body of the callback request - Accepted values for the status field are \u201ccompleted\u201d and \u201cfailed\u201d. Zluri expects the \u201czluri_execution_id\u201d to be sent as a parameter in the callback request - This value will be auto-generated when the action is triggered from Zluri and sent as a parameter in the body of the HTTP request. Zluri will also require an \u201capi_key\u201d or \u201capi-key\u201d to be sent in the headers for authentication when making the callback request. You can contact your Zluri support representative to get the value of the API key for your organization. Once this action is configured on both Zluri and the external application or service, if you\u2019d like to test the callback request, you can make a test call to Zluri using the callback URL generated on the UI along with the status, the api_key, and a zluri_execution_id value of 11111111. If you receive a \u201c200 OK\u201d response when making the test call, that indicates that the test call is successful. If the action has failed from Zluri\u2019s end or the callback request is configured incorrectly, you can check the error or work with Zluri support to resolve any errors from Zluri\u2019s end and retry. On successful completion of the action, Zluri will change the status of the action from \u201cfailed\u201d or \u201cpending\u201d to \u201ccompleted\u201d on Zluri\u2019s logs. Updated8 months ago",

        "What is the difference between Risk and Threat?": " The \u2018Risk\u2019 level is a holistic metric determined by carefully assessing a set of essential parameters like security events, scopes shared, compliance information, security probes etc. The Risk level can also manually be overridden. \u2018Threat\u2019 level is determined based on the app's scopes and permissions to read and edit your data. Zluri provides you with a 360-degree view of security & compliance with each SaaS application you use in your organization. It considers the following factors while calculating the risk score: Based on the above-mentioned factors, zluri assigns a security score rating from 1 to 5, where 1 & 2 means low risk, 3 is medium risk & 4,5 means high risk. What actions can be taken based on the security scores? Actions can be taken based on the authorization status of the applications. A few scenarios are explained below. Updatedabout 2 months ago"
